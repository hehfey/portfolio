                            <p>I enrolled into Northwest Arkansas Community College with the desire to obtain a transfer degree to finish my bachelors through the University of Arkansas. In October of 2018 I joined Prime Software Solutions and decided that I wanted to take advantage of the growing company and left college full time. I hope to be able to go back and finish one day.</p>
